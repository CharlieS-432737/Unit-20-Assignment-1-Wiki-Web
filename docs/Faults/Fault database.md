# <u>**Fault databases**</u>

Once a fault has been found, the IT technician will create a ticket using a web-based ticketing system. The ticket will be saved to the fault database. The ticket will contain information about the fault. Information like: the time and date of the fault, a description of the fault, the location of the fault, (if required) the steps to reproduce the fault, the IT technician who reported it and the level of severity. Once in the database, an automated system will assign an IT technician to the fault based on the level of severity of the fault (low-level severity will get assigned a lower-level IT technician).

If the IT technician was unable to fix the fault, the ticket can be escalated to a higher-level IT technician.

Once a fault has been fixed, the IT technician will add notes and steps to fix the fault to the ticket and it will get marked as fixed. When a ticket gets marked as fixed a program moves the ticket from the fault database to a solution database. The solution database can be used in the future to help fix future faults.
