# <u>**License management**</u>

The organisation will have a record of the license keys that are in use within the organisation stored within a database on the server. Within this database will be the license key the source or website that the key was purchased from, the software that key is for, how many devices are using that key and the expiration date of that key.

The database should be reviewed monthly to check the expiration dates of the license keys.
