# <u>**Access control**</u>

Each employee will be given a certain amount of access to the organisation's network. The level of access will depend on their specific role within the organisations. This will help prevent a rouge employee or a 3rd party using an employee login from ruining the network or potentially stealing or deleting important data from the server.

Access control for each user will be based on 3 types of access:

    - Mandatory access
      - This will be the access that every employee will need to be able to do basic tasks within the organisation. Things like access to both the LAN and wireless networks and access to the emailing system for the organisation.
    - Role-based access
      - This will be the access to specific hardware, files and locations based on the job of the employees. This will give access to things like folders that only need to be accessed by a specific job. 
    - Discretionary access
      - This is access that is set by the user which restricts access to a folder or file. This will help keep an employee's data safe from other employees.
