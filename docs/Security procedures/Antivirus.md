# <u>**Antivirus**</u>

For every system that the organisation owns, a form of antivirus must be installed on it before being used by employees. For desktops and mobile devices, Malwarebytes will be installed on them and they will run daily antivirus scans. For Linux systems/servers, ClamAV will be installed on them and will also have daily antivirus scans run on them. Having daily scans will help with detecting when a piece of malware has infected the network. If a virus were to be detected on an organisation's device then the virus infection contingency plan should be followed. Antivirus software will be set to auto update. Preventing new virus from getting pass the antivirus.
