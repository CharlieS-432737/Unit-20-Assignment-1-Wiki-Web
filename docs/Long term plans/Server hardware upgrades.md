# <u>**Server hardware upgrades**</u>

Server hardware upgrades will only be performed if it's decided that the current hardware is no longer suitable for their job or is unable to handle the capacity needed.

Server hardware upgrades will be conducted during times when the server is used the least (weekends or holidays). During an upgrade, the server will be taken offline and (if needed) a temporary server will be used to allow employees to access data if needed. While the server is offline the upgrades will be performed and testing will start. Once the server has been thoroughly tested, the server will be redeployed on the network. Any files that were changed on the temporary server will be moved to the main server.
