# <u>**Support analysis**</u>

At the end of each month, the support team will review the support tickets made over the past month. During this review, common patterns will attempt to be identified. Some examples of commons patterns could be:

- Common issues with certain software or hardware
  - If there are common issues with certain software or hardware alternatives can be found that potentially fix the issue
- The times and dates of issues
  - If common issues are happening at set times of the day then there could be a deeper problem on the network
  - This can also help with assigning support staff allowing more staff to be present at days and times when more support tickets are being made
- If the issue needs to be escalated
  - This could indicate if the support team needs certain training to help prevent tickets from being escalated
