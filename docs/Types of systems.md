# <u>**Types of systems**</u>

Within the organisations, many different types of devices will be deployed to help the organisation function.

## BYOD

Employees will be allowed to bring their own devices for use within the organisation. They will have many restrictions but will be able to access basic systems like the employee's email and work area in the cloud. 

## Cloud storage

Each employee will have their own storage area within the cloud so the user can upload documents. The organisation will also have an area for storing backups that can be accessed in case a restore is needed to be complete.

## Desktops

Each employee will a desktop that they can use. The desktop will have everything like antivirus, firewall, software and security policies already set up on them. The employees will be restricted from doing many actions that may damage or open up the network to vulnerabilities.

## Laptops

Employees can request a work laptop. They will be a setup similar to the desktops with the ability to access the WLAN.

## Mobile devices

Employees can request a work phone. The phones will be heavily restricted and to be used as only a communication device for the employee.

## Servers

The organisations will have servers that will store the organisation's files, control backups, control monitoring software and store databases that are required for the organisation to function. These can only be accessed by IT technicians.

## Virtual PCs

The organisation will have a few virtual servers that will help control part of the network and make the management of the systems easier. These can only be accessed by IT technicians.
