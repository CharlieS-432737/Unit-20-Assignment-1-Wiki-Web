# <u>**Drive imaging**</u>

Drive imaging will involve creating an image of drives that includes all files including system files. These will be performed once a month to allow the images to be kept up to date but not take up a huge amount of space on the server or cloud.

If a full drive restore needs to be done the same software that was used to create the image will be used to restore the image on the machine

## The importance of drive imaging

Drive imaging is a critical backup solution for organizations as it provides a comprehensive and efficient way to restore systems in case of data loss or system failure. Drive images allow IT administrators to restore an entire system, including the operating system, applications, and data, to a previous state quickly and easily. This minimizes the downtime caused by data loss, which can result in productivity and financial losses. Drive images are also useful for maintaining consistency across systems, allowing IT administrators to easily replicate system configurations across multiple devices. Additionally, drive imaging provides an additional layer of protection against cyber attacks, allowing organizations to quickly recover from any security breaches.
