# <u>**Drive imaging**</u>

Drive imaging will involve creating an image of drives that includes all files including system files. These will be performed once a month to allow the images to be kept up to date but not take up a huge amount of space on the server or cloud.

If a full drive restore needs to be done the same software that was used to create the image will be used to restore the image on the machine
